This directory contains Escudo web browser.

Escudo web browser, currently being developed as one of the ES operating
system projects, contains a totally new CSS/HTML rendering engine written
in C++11. Escudo can be configured with SpiderMonkey or V8 JavaScript
engine along with the C++11 Web IDL binding of the esidl Web IDL compiler.
For the graphics backend, Escudo web browser uses OpenGL for the better
performance and portability.

The core components of the Escudo web browser will be used like a window
system in today's operating systems in the ES operating system, but before
doing so, we are experimenting it as a standalone web browser on Linux.
The user interface of the Escudo web browser itself is written in HTML/CSS
and JavaScript on top of the Escudo core components.
